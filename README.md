# Texture-Feature-Extraction-for-Crack-Detection-using-Supervised-Learning


This project addresses the crucial task of pavement maintenance, which plays a vital role in ensuring quality and safety. The presence of cracks in roads and buildings poses a threat to both human safety and economic stability. Manual inspection for crack detection is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, to automate this process, various image processing techniques have been applied.  In this research, the focus is on automating the classification of cracks and measuring the severity levels. Multiple algorithms have been proposed and extensive experiments have been conducted to achieve accurate crack classification. Through this research, it has been observed that Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most effective classifier, particularly when dealing with multi-label classification scenarios.  The project aims to provide an automated solution for crack detection and classification, simplifying the inspection process and enabling timely maintenance. The associated repository contains the code implementation, datasets, and detailed documentation of the research findings and experiments conducted. This project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in using image processing techniques for crack detection and maintenance in various infrastructure settings.
